# BALE — Roadmap & Open Work

Tracked in-repo because the GitHub issue list is empty, which meant the next
planned work lived nowhere. Sections are ordered by intended sequence.

Legend: **Verified** = checked in this checkout (tests, typecheck, build, smoke).
**Needs live project** = cannot be completed or confirmed without the Supabase /
production credentials. **Open** = known work, deliberately deferred.

---

## Done — security pass (Part 1)

- **Next 14.2.35 advisories (incl. critical GHSA-2xp9-vwfh-vxw4, Image
  Optimizer RCE).** Verified: `images.unoptimized: true` (optimizer disabled),
  `images.remotePatterns` narrowed from `hostname: '**'`, no `next/image` import
  anywhere, no `sharp` in the lockfile. The **upgrade to 16.x is the real fix**
  and is tracked below as its own PR.
- **Receipts bucket private + signed URLs.** Verified: migration
  `20261006000000_security_hardening.sql` flips `storage.buckets.public = false`,
  rewrites existing `expenses.receipt_url` values (public URL or signed URL →
  bare storage path, tokens stripped) and clears unresolvable absolute URLs.
  Uploads store a path; reads mint a 5-minute signed URL
  (`lib/supabase/receipts.ts`).
- **Security headers.** Verified: CSP (`default-src 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`,
  `base-uri`/`form-action 'self'`, dev-permissive `frame-ancestors` for the
  sandbox preview, `frame-ancestors 'none'` + `X-Frame-Options: DENY` + HSTS in
  production), `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`,
  `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`.
- **Rate limiting.** Verified: sliding-window limiter (`lib/rateLimit.ts`) with
  named per-route budgets; SMS 15/10 min, SMTP test 5/hour, email send
  20/hour, AI extraction 12/min. Keys prefer the authenticated user id and fall
  back to the proxy-appended client address. 429 responses carry `Retry-After`
  and a message stating the limit and the wait.
- **Founder MFA.** Verified: real Supabase TOTP enrolment/verification with the
  aal1→aal2 gate (`app/mfa`, `components/auth/MfaCard.tsx`); the decorative
  toggle that claimed MFA while doing nothing is gone. Enforcement is opt-in via
  `MFA_ENFORCE_FOUNDERS` (rollout order in `docs/SECURITY.md` §5).
- **SMTP `requireTLS`.** Verified: `requireTLS: true` and `minVersion: 'TLSv1.2'`
  (dev-only opt-out via `SMTP_REQUIRE_TLS=false`).
- **Audit log for financial mutations.** Verified: `public.audit_log` with
  before/after JSONB, Founder-only select/insert, **no update/delete policy at
  all**, wired into invoice / expense / advance / payroll mutations.
- **RLS regression test.** Verified: `tests/rls-migration.test.ts` asserts RLS is
  enabled on every migrated `public.*` table, no `using (true)` survives, and
  every policy is scoped `to authenticated` — this caught the real finding that
  the base schema's 23 policies had **no `TO` clause** and therefore applied to
  `anon` as well; `20261006000002_security_hardening.sql` re-scopes all of them
  and pins `search_path` on the `security definer` helpers.
- **Receipt extension allowlist.** Verified: extension is derived from the MIME
  type (never the uploaded filename), allowlist JPEG/PNG/WebP, ≤5 MB, randomised
  object key.
- **Seed password warning + rotation.** Verified: boxed "LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY"
  warning in `20260913000002_bale_seed.sql`, rotation SQL + procedure in
  `docs/SECURITY.md` §9, and a test that the published demo password appears in
  no non-seed migration.
- **CSRF reasoning documented.** `docs/SECURITY.md` §11 (no token by design:
  `SameSite=Lax` cookies + JSON-only bodies + no state-changing `GET`).
- **RA 10173 compliance notes.** `docs/PRIVACY.md`: processing inventory,
  sub-processor list, draft privacy notice, retention schedule with review
  queries, 72-hour breach runbook, DPO/NPC-registration checkpoints.
- **Session policy (Part 2).** Verified: idle 20 min + absolute 8 h, both
  mirrored in `supabase/config.toml` (`[auth.sessions] inactivity_timeout`,
  `timebox`), warning dialog before either deadline with "Stay signed in"
  (activity only, never extends the absolute limit), countdown + spoken
  countdown, deliberate-logout flag to distinguish an expired session from a
  finished one.

## Done — AI tracks (Part 3)

- **Track E — one messy line → structured draft.** Verified: 35 tests. Amount
  and date must be *quoted* in the source text or they are dropped; project and
  vendor resolve only to real database ids; ambiguity is refused rather than
  guessed; the model's amount is used only when its quote verifies, otherwise
  the rules layer's reading is used *and the substitution is disclosed*.
- **Track A — vendor memory, count-based.** Verified: `vendor_memory` records
  accepted/overridden counts per normalised supplier token;
  `record_vendor_outcome()` updates counters server-side; a category is
  suggested only when the measured rate clears a stated threshold, and the
  suggestion always carries that measurement as its evidence. No embeddings.
- **Track C — duplicate & outlier detection (arithmetic).** Verified: same
  amount ±₱0.01 within 7 days **and** (same project **or** same supplier);
  different named suppliers in the same project are explicitly *not* duplicates;
  outliers are median-based with a minimum-history guard; receipts are required
  at ₱5,000; ledger-wide pair de-duplication.
- **Track B — receipt photo → draft.** Verified: Groq vision with the image sent
  as a base64 data URI (never a signed URL), 4 MB cap, current model IDs
  (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`; Llama 4 Scout is retired on the free tier), degrade to
  manual entry with the reason shown.
- **Track D — voice → draft.** Verified: `whisper-large-v3-turbo`, name-seeded
  prompt built from real worker/project/supplier names (700-char cap under the
  224-token limit), 20 MB guard, transcription is transcription — the draft still
  has to pass the same no-invented-values gate as text.
- **Model IDs are data, not code.** All three resolve through `lib/ai/models.ts`
  with environment overrides and are reported by `/api/integrations/status`,
  because Groq retired both model IDs this app had been using.

## Open — security (deliberately deferred)

- **Upgrade off Next 14.x (its own PR).** 14.x receives no more security
  patches; the header/optimizer work is a mitigation, not a fix. Target 16.3.8+
  (or 15.5.24+), expect React 19 and App Router changes, and re-run the full
  test suite plus the runtime smoke checks. **Never `npm audit fix --force`.**
- **Remove `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src`.** Requires a per-request nonce
  threaded through middleware — real work, not faked.
- **Rate limiter is single-instance.** Counters are in-process; the honest
  limitation is documented in `docs/SECURITY.md` §7. A multi-instance deploy
  needs a shared store (Upstash Redis / a Supabase table) behind the same
  `checkRateLimit` interface.
- **Login brute force is not covered by this limiter** — the browser talks
  directly to Supabase Auth. Configure Supabase's own rate limits (and consider
  CAPTCHA) per `docs/SECURITY.md` §7.
- **Audit-log viewer** — the trail is query-only via SQL today; a Founder-facing
  view is a candidate follow-up.

## Needs live project (blocked, not abandoned)

- **Apply migrations** `2026100600000{0,1,2}_*.sql` to a real project, then
  smoke-test: bucket is private, an old receipt still opens (re-attach if not —
  the backfill clears URLs it cannot resolve), a mutation writes an audit row.
- **Backups/PITR:** verify the plan, then **perform and record a test restore**
  (table in `docs/SECURITY.md` §10 — currently marked not performed).
- **MFA rollout:** deploy with `MFA_ENFORCE_FOUNDERS=false` → both founders
  enrol → flip to `true` → confirm a Founder without a code is redirected.
- **Session fields** in the managed dashboard must match `supabase/config.toml`
  (20 min idle / 8 h absolute); `config.toml` only governs the local stack.

## Backlog

- `store.tsx` and component tests (coverage is server-logic only).
- Adopt `isSupabaseConfigured()` fail-fast path in more entry points if needed.
- Navbar timestamp still uses a raw `toLocaleString` (datetime, not currency).
- Automated data-retention purge (see `docs/PRIVACY.md` §5) — manual review is
  the current answer.
