/**
 * Track B — receipt photo → draft.
 *
 * Reads a receipt image with a Groq vision model and returns the raw text plus
 * candidate fields. It does NOT decide anything: the caller runs the result
 * through the same verification gates as a typed description
 * (lib/ai/draft.ts) and the Founder confirms every field against the photo.
 *
 * THREE DELIBERATE CONSTRAINTS
 * ----------------------------
 * 1. The image is sent as a BASE64 DATA URI, never as a URL. The `receipts`
 *    bucket is private (migration 20261006000000) precisely because receipts
 *    leak supplier names, amounts and TINs; handing Groq a signed URL would
 *    re-open that hole from the other end.
 * 2. Handwritten and faded thermal receipts are hit-or-miss. Failure is
 *    reported as failure and the manual path is unaffected.
 * 3. A vision model is a PREVIEW-grade helper, so the UI labels its output
 *    "read from the photo — check every field". It is never authoritative.

Hard rules:
- Read what is there. NEVER guess a number that is not legible: use null.
- If the image is not a receipt, or is too blurry to read, return receipt_text "" and nulls.
- amount must be the TOTAL, not a line item. If you cannot tell which is the total, use null.
- Quotes must be copied exactly from the receipt text.
- Output JSON only. No prose, no markdown.`;
