/**
 * In-process rate limiting for BALE's API routes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The app had no limiter at all. The routes that matter cost real money or
 * real trust:
 *   - /api/sms/send  → every message is billed by PhilSMS.
 *   - /api/email/test, /api/email/request-payment → outbound mail volume.
 *   - /api/ai/*      → paid Groq tokens.
 * A stuck retry loop in a browser tab was enough to burn an SMS budget.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT
 * ----------------
 * This is a *single-instance* limiter: counters live in module memory. On a
 * serverless platform that scales horizontally each instance keeps its own
 * counter, so the effective limit is `limit × instanceCount`. It reliably
 * stops accidental loops, double-submits, and casual abuse from one client; it
 * is not a defence against a distributed attacker. The production upgrade path
 * (documented in docs/SECURITY.md) is a shared store — Upstash Redis, or a
 * Supabase table — plugged into the same `checkRateLimit` interface.
 *
 * Login brute-force cannot be covered here at all: the browser talks to
 * Supabase Auth directly (`supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`), so those
 * requests never reach this process. Supabase Auth applies its own per-IP
 * limits, which is the honest answer recorded in docs/SECURITY.md.
