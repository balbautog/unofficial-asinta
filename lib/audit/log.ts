/**
 * Append-only audit trail for financial mutations.
 *
 * WHAT IS RECORDED
 * ----------------
 * Inserts, updates and deletes on the tables that move money: `invoices`,
 * `expenses`, `advances` and `payroll`. Each entry stores WHO (actor id and the
 * email at the time of the action), WHAT (table + record id), WHICH operation,
 * and the full row snapshot BEFORE and AFTER — so "this invoice was marked paid"
 * is backed by "amount_paid went from 0 to 120,000".
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT
 * -----------
 * This is not tamper-proof storage: a database superuser can still edit
 * Postgres directly. What it does guarantee is that no application path —
 * including a stolen Founder session — can rewrite history, because the
 * `audit_log` table has Founder INSERT/SELECT policies and deliberately NO
 * update or delete policy at all.
 *
 * Failure handling is visible, never silent: if the audit write fails, the
 * caller tells the Founder the change was saved but not logged. We do not block
 * the ledger write on the audit write — losing an expense entry because the
 * trail was unavailable would be worse — but we never pretend it was recorded.
