-- BALE — Security hardening (2026-10-06)
--
-- Two confirmed findings, both reachable in production until this migration:
--
--   1. The `receipts` Storage bucket was created with `public = true`. Storage
--      policies restricted UPLOAD and LIST to Founders, but a public bucket
--      bypasses auth on READ — anyone holding the URL could fetch a receipt
--      photo. Receipts routinely show supplier names, amounts, TINs, and
--      sometimes signatures or card fragments.
--      Fix: private bucket + short-lived signed URLs. expenses.receipt_url now
--      stores the STORAGE PATH, not a URL (see lib/supabase/receipts.ts).
--
--   2. Financial mutations left no trail. There is now an append-only
--      `audit_log` with Founder-only read access and NO update/delete policy,
--      so a row cannot be edited or erased through any RLS-respecting client.
--
-- Applying this migration is idempotent and safe to re-run.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Receipts bucket: public → private
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

update storage.buckets
set public = false
where id = 'receipts' and public is distinct from false;

-- Policies are unchanged: Founders already hold select/insert/update/delete on
-- this bucket via public.is_founder(). `createSignedUrl()` requires the SELECT
-- policy, which is why signed URLs keep working after the bucket is private.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Backfill: public/signed receipt URLs → storage paths
--
-- Rows written before this migration hold one of:
--   https://<ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/receipts/<path>
--   https://<ref>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/sign/receipts/<path>?token=…
-- The app now resolves a signed URL from the path at render time, so any
-- absolute URL left in place would be both broken and permanently public.
--
-- Note: the query string is stripped BEFORE the prefix, because a signed URL's
-- token would otherwise travel with the path.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

update public.expenses
set receipt_url = split_part(receipt_url, '?', 1)
where receipt_url ~ '^https?://' and receipt_url like '%?%';

update public.expenses
set receipt_url = regexp_replace(
      receipt_url,
      '^.*/storage/v1/object/(public|sign|authenticated)/receipts/',
      ''
    )
where receipt_url ~ '/storage/v1/object/(public|sign|authenticated)/receipts/';

-- Anything that is still an absolute URL is not a storage path and cannot be
-- signed. Leaving it would make the UI claim a receipt is available when it is
-- not, so it is cleared and the Founder re-attaches the photo.
update public.expenses
set receipt_url = null
where receipt_url ~ '^https?://';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. audit_log — append-only trail for financial mutations
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

create table if not exists public.audit_log (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    -- Nullable: a system/migration action has no human actor.
    actor_id UUID REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    actor_email TEXT,
    -- insert | update | delete
    action TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('insert', 'update', 'delete')),
    table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    record_id UUID,
    -- Full row snapshots. BEFORE is null on insert, AFTER is null on delete.
    before_row JSONB,
    after_row JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

  on public.audit_log (table_name, record_id, created_at DESC);

-- Founders read the trail…
drop policy if exists "Founders can read the audit log" on public.audit_log;
create policy "Founders can read the audit log"
  on public.audit_log for select
  to authenticated

-- from writing an entry that blames someone else.

-- Deliberately NO update and NO delete policy: with RLS enabled, any
-- UPDATE/DELETE matching zero policies is denied. The trail cannot be rewritten
-- by whoever happens to hold a Founder session.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Scope every existing policy to `authenticated`
--
-- The original policies omitted the TO clause, which defaults the policy to
-- PUBLIC — the anon role included. Their USING expressions already require a
-- real user (`public.is_founder()` / `auth.uid()`), so anon could not pass
-- them; this change removes the possibility that a future policy is written in
-- the same shape with a condition anon CAN satisfy. Semantics for signed-in
-- users are unchanged, which is why this is a mechanical drop-and-recreate.

-- unqualified name with an object in a schema they control.
