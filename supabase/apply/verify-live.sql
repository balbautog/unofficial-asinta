-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor (or psql) AFTER applying a bundle from
-- this folder. It is READ-ONLY and safe to run any number of times.
--
-- Every row should say PASS. A FAIL row names the problem and tells you which
-- migration to apply. This turns the static guards in tests/rls-migration.test.ts
-- into checks against the live database.
