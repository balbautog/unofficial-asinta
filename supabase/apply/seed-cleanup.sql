-- BALE — demo seed remediation
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
-- --------------------
-- supabase/migrations/20260913000002_bale_seed.sql was applied to the live
-- project. It created four auth accounts:
--
--     02f773a0-abec-4916-9858-e9e547782bc3   junel@asinta.ph          founder
--     b5117c39-e80b-cded-2c90-510de7ce7512   rei@asinta.ph            founder
--     a564529f-1d75-aeec-1b99-a2391b321b90   marco.santos@asinta.ph   supervisor
--     494fdb42-abc2-1f62-2745-0f60da3bc00e   carlos.reyes@asinta.ph   supervisor
--
-- all four with the password `asinta2026`, which is published in this
-- repository. Two of those addresses are the firm's real founder addresses.
-- Anyone who reads the repo can sign in to the firm's books.
--
-- This is the ONLY remediation procedure. It runs in three sections:
--
--     §1  ROTATE               — new password on every account still using
--                                the published one. Do this first; it closes
--                                the hole on its own, whether or not you ever
--                                run §3.
--     §2  FORCE RE-AUTH        — revoke every live session and refresh token,
--                                so an old token cannot outlive the rotation.
--     §3  DELETE DEMO DATA     — remove the four accounts, their profiles and
--                                the 57 fictional rows. ARMED OFF BY DEFAULT:
--                                it deletes rows, and two of the accounts use
--                                real founder addresses you may want to keep.
--
-- §1 and §2 are safe to run immediately and can be re-run. §3 needs one edit
-- first, and is atomic — it either deletes all of it or none of it.
--
-- TAKE A BACKUP / CONFIRM PITR IS ON BEFORE §3. Order and rationale:
-- docs/GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md. Background: docs/SECURITY.md §9 and
-- docs/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md.

-- ===========================================================================
-- §1 — ROTATE
-- ===========================================================================
-- EDIT THE PASSWORD ON THE LINE MARKED <<< THEN RUN THIS SECTION.
--
-- This selects accounts by VERIFYING the stored hash against the published
-- password — `encrypted_password = crypt('asinta2026', encrypted_password)` —
-- not by email address. That way it catches every account holding that
-- password, including any that are not in the list above, and it leaves every
-- account that already has its own password untouched. (bcrypt keeps its salt
-- inside the hash, so re-hashing with the stored value as the salt reproduces
-- it exactly when, and only when, the password matches.)
-- ===========================================================================

      'k_new_password (the line marked <<< EDIT THIS) to a new strong password, then re-run.';
  end if;

  if length(k_new_password) < 12 then
    raise exception

      'least 12 (16+ recommended for a Founder on a financial system).', length(k_new_password);

end $rotate$;


-- ===========================================================================
-- §2 — FORCE RE-AUTHENTICATION
-- ===========================================================================
-- Rotating a password does not end a session that was already minted: an
-- access token stays valid until it expires and a refresh token can mint a new
-- one. This deletes both, for every account, so the next request has to
-- present the new password.
--
-- Both GoTrue table layouts are handled — newer projects use `auth.sessions`,
-- older ones `auth.refresh_tokens`. A table that is not there is skipped, not
-- reported as an error. Nothing in public.* is touched.
-- ===========================================================================

do $reauth$
declare
  v_sessions int := 0;
  v_refresh  int := 0;

    'is now signed out, including yours — sign back in with the new password.',
    v_sessions, v_refresh;
end $reauth$;


-- ===========================================================================
-- §3 — DELETE THE DEMO ACCOUNTS AND DATA
-- ===========================================================================
-- DESTRUCTIVE, AND ARMED OFF BY DEFAULT. Nothing is deleted until you change
-- k_armed to true on the line marked <<< ARM THIS.
--
-- READ THIS BEFORE ARMING IT
-- --------------------------
-- · Two of the four accounts use the firm's REAL founder addresses
--   (junel@asinta.ph, rei@asinta.ph). If those are genuinely the founders'
--   logins and you want to keep them, STOP HERE: §1 already gave them a new
--   password and §2 has signed every session out. Do not run §3 — instead
--   delete just the two supervisor accounts by removing their UUIDs from
--   k_demo_users below.
-- · If you delete the founders, recreate them afterwards through the Auth
--   dashboard and link each one with a public.users row (role = 'founder').
--   That procedure is docs/MIGRATION_RUNBOOK.md §6.
-- · §3 deletes only rows whose UUIDs the seed inserted. Any real data added
--   since is left alone. It runs in one transaction: if a foreign key blocks a
--   delete — which would mean real data now points at a demo row — nothing is
--   deleted and you decide by hand.
-- · Receipts: the seed stored absolute unsplash.com URLs, not uploaded files,
--   so there are no storage objects to remove. The hardening migration clears
--   those URLs as part of its backfill.
